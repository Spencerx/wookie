I like the variety in the menu and the presentation of the food was a nice amenity. I was a little disappointed with the ambiance. Not a bad thing, I thought it would be a little bit more lively and crowded, but instead of it was more quiet than I thought. Which wasnt a bad thing, since my friend and I didnt have to wait for a table and could hear each other talk. Overall, I would recommend this place, but I little bit overrated, I thought reading from the other reviewers."

The bacon wrapped scallops, seafood salad and pink cadillac are especially worth noting. Service and atmosphere are nice as well.

We ordered a starter -tuna tar tar, spicy salmon sushi, uni sushi,beef teriyaki (medium rare) w/ sashimi. The restaurant was so busy that our food came after a 20 min. wait.Whats worst is they first served a well done beef teriyaki with rice. Then after following up our other orders bec another 10 mins passed they served the sashimi and sushi. The uni sushi was great but the spicy salmon was not a bit spicy.I was disappointed. The last order that arrived was our starter-the tuna tar tar. Overall, we did not have a good experience with this restaurant with such high reviews."

(the lines are long). first a warning: you can wait up to 2hrs to get in here (my friends say in all sincerity). well I went for the 3rd time last thursday and there was no wait, but the waitress broke a glass and I found a glass chip by my sushi roll! it kinda freaked me out. so ah I am giving them 3 stars, only because I pointed out the glass chip and the waitress basically said \"so what\" ! ha. VERY nice sushi maker guy though..."

      "LastReviewIntro": " Took some friends for some sake and sushi. We sat at the sushi counter in front of a chef who was busy talking to the waitress and hardly noticed us - think his name was Leo. We looked the menu over and finally decided what we wanted. We were finally able to flag down our waitress as she was busy talking with Leo. We ordered nigori sake (which was great), some sashimi (seemed soggy), some nigiri (good) and a couple of yoko rolls (also good). We would have liked to have been able to order another round of drinks but couldnt find our waitress. So we decided to just get the bill...another hassle trying to get our waitress as she was back talking again. Conclusion: the drinks/food is great but the service/attentiveness towards customers definitely needs improvement."
